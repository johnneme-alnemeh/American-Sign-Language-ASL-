# American-Sign-Language (ASL):
# ASL Letter Recognition with Machine Learning

This repository houses a machine learning model designed to interpret American Sign Language (ASL) gestures for the letters F, B, G, K, and L. The model employs three distinct algorithms: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree, offering a comprehensive comparison of their performance in ASL letter recognition.

# Key Features:

ASL Letter Recognition: The model accurately identifies hand gestures corresponding to the ASL letters F, B, G, K, and L, facilitating communication for individuals with hearing impairments.

Multiple Algorithms: Three popular machine learning algorithms—Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree—are implemented and evaluated to determine the most effective approach for ASL letter recognition.

Scalability and Flexibility: The codebase is scalable and easily adaptable, allowing for experimentation with other algorithms, datasets, and preprocessing techniques to further enhance performance.

# Usage:

Training: Utilize the provided datasets to train the machine learning models using SVM, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree algorithms. Fine-tune parameters as needed for optimal performance.

Evaluation: Evaluate the trained models using appropriate metrics to compare their accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Testing: Test the models with new ASL gesture samples to assess real-world performance and validate the effectiveness of the implemented algorithms.
